Well, there's Gary Kasparov, who has a very good pace, I think, and then there's Fischer as well. Bobby Fischer kind of had, I would say, the highest peak in terms of the difference between him and his competitors, at least in recent times. The problem with Fischer is that he kind of stopped playing right after he became world champion. He had that three-year peak from 70 to 72.
